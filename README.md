# LEAP Dashboard

The [Local Energy Alliance Program](https://www.leap-va.org/) (LEAP) is a nonprofit organization that delivers energy efficiency solutions in Virginia to make homes safer, healthier, and more affordable while reducing energy usage and mitigating climate change.

[Data Science for Sustainable Development](https://dssdglobal.org/) (DSSD), a nonprofit that provides technical services to social impact organizations, has partnered with LEAP to develop this dashboard. A team of students from the University of Florida contributed to the development of this dashboard in collaboration with LEAP.

Key Features:
- Interactive Map: See LEAP's impact across Virginia's counties and cities. Hover over an area to see the number of people served.
- Updated Metrics: The data on this dashboard are pulled directly from LEAP's documentation and are constantly updated to reflect present values. You can toggle between statewide totals and household averages.
